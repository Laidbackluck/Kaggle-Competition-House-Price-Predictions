The competition solution workflow goes through seven stages described in the Data Science Solutions book.

1. Question or problem definition.
2. Acquire training and testing data.
3. Wrangle, prepare, cleanse the data.
4. Analyze, identify patterns, and explore the data.
5. Model, predict and solve the problem.
6. Visualize, report, and present the problem solving steps and final solution.
7. Supply or submit the results.

## Question and problem definition
The question or problem definition for House Price competition is [described here at Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/overview).

Competition Description:

Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this playground competition's dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence.

With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, this competition challenges you to predict the final price of each home.
